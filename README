Completed version of the Angular 'Tour of Heroes' tutorial app, but with a twist - one additional script has been added to make it run with electron.

Want to try it out?
1. Used node.js version 7.10.0
1. Clone repo
1. `npm install`
1. Probably going to need to install Electron as well `npm install -g electron`
1. Run `npm run-script electron` OR
1. Run `npm start` to ng serve the web app so it can be accessed from Chrome
